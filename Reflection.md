## Final Project Reflection

### The Beginning

I started off this project using my code from the Thanksgiving assignment as a base. I did change the database to use the e-commerce data from several assignments ago. That, of course, required refactoring everything that needed the exact object structure to ensure everything was added and displayed properly.

- For example, `addDishes` in `state.js` was renamed to `addItems`, and refactored to match the object structure of the db.
